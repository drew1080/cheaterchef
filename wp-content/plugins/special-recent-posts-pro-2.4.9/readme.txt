== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Plugin shows no thumbnails =

This issue might be caused by several problems. Check the following list.
<ol>
<li>First of all, make sure the relative post has at least one image inserted in its text content or a featured image assigned. Posts with no images are displayed with the default "no image" placeholder.</li>
<li>Set the correct permissions on the cache folder. In order to generate the thumbnails, the plugin needs to write in the cache folder, located under special-recent-posts-free-VERSION-NUMBER/cache/
Be sure this folder is set to 0775 or 0777. Please ask to your system administrator if you're not sure what you are doing.</li>
<li>Thumbnails are rendered using the PHP GD libraries. These should be enabled on your server. Do a phpinfo() on your host to check if they're installed properly. Contact your hosting support to know how to enable them.</li>
<li>Another problem could be that you're hosting the plugin on a MS Windows based machine. This will probably change the encoding data inside the files and could lead to several malfunctions. Better to host your site on a Unix/Linux based environment.</li>
<li>External images are not allowed. This means that if you're trying to generate a thumbnail from an image hosted on a different domain, it just won't work. This is usually not allowed for security reasons.</li>
</ol>

= Category/Post filtering isn't working =

In order to properly filter posts by categories, you must provide a numeric value which is the Category ID.
Every Wordpress category has an unique Identification number, and this can be found doing the following steps:
<ol>
<li>Go in the  Posts->Categories panel</li>
<li>Mouse over a category name.</li>
<li>Look at the status bar at the very bottom of your browser window. There you will find a long string containing a parameter called <strong>tag_ID</strong> and its following value.</li>
<li>Take note of that number, which is the relative Category ID to insert in the SRP PRO filtering panel.</li>
</ol>

NOTE: Please remember that this procedure is also valid for post filtering.

<p><strong>Please read the included PDF manual for further F.A.Q</strong></p>

== Requirements ==

1. PHP version 5+
